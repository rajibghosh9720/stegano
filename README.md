Stegano is a steganography application which uses LSB Steganography to encode text into image files.

## üìù Introduction

Steganography is the practice of concealing a secret message within an ordinary message or file, without anyone else being aware that there is a hidden message. The goal of steganography is to hide the existence of the message, so that it can be transmitted undetected. Unlike cryptography, which relies on encryption to make a message unreadable to anyone who doesn't have the key, steganography does not alter the message in any way. Instead, it hides the message within the data of another file, such as an image or audio file, by subtly changing certain bits of information. Steganography can be used for a variety of purposes, from covert communication to digital watermarking, and has been used throughout history in various forms.

Our steganography application provides a user-friendly interface for users to hide text messages inside images using the LSB technique. It also allows users to decode text from an encoded image to retrieve hidden messages.

## üå± Implementation

The application converts the entire message to Base64 to avoid any conversion loss, then it converts it to bytes hence to its bits. Then, it gets each pixel, breaks each pixel into its channels (Red, Green, Blue and Alpha) and breaks down each channel into bits. Once this is done, rest is just replacing each bit with the message's bits. Depending on your content, this process can take a while. Once the process is completed, you can download the file.  

## ‚ú® Features

- Hide text messages inside images using LSB steganography.
- Decode hidden text from an encoded image.
- Support for multiple image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
- Intuitive and responsive user interface built with React JS.
